# Watch-Verse
**Final group project for Dev Academy Aotearoa - March 3rd, 2022**

This project idea was born from the fist Covid lockdown in New Zealand where Disney+ was a new streaming service on the market 
and to fill in the long evenings of being stuck in your home we decided to watch all of the Marvel Movies in the order of when they happened in time rather than their movie release date. 

It was difficult to find this information out on the internet and this site provides a place to see the possible watch orders of different cinematic universes such as Marvel or Star Wars. 

## Getting Started
